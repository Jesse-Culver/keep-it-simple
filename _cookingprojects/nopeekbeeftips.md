{% include heading.html heading="Ingredients" size="large" %}
* 3 pounds of cubed beef (approximate 1" cubes)
* 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup
* 2 packets of dry mushroom soup
* 1 can of ginger ale soda

{% include heading.html heading="Instructions" size="large" %}

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees fahrenheit
2. Mix ingredients in roasting pan & cover
3. Bake for 3 to 3 and a half hours **DO NOT OPEN LID UNTIL DONE**

Alternatively you can cook in a slower cooker set to medium for about 2 hours then switch to low for the remaining time.

Goes great with mashed potatoes!
