This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme I created after reading [Fabien Sanglard's blog post](https://fabiensanglard.net/bloated/index.html) on how bloated the web has become and finding myself agreeing. Websites have become bloated garbage over the years where people just grab every npm package they think they need and shove it into their website with performance and size taking a back seat. At the same time people who want to have their own website whether it's a personal blog or a place for their school club feel pressured to actually learn how to develop a full stack web server or find a company that will over charge them every month for a drag and drop editor that was sold to them from a podcast advertisement. We have become spoiled by the power that is available to us with modern machines without considering those who do not have the newest cell phone or computer.

Most people just want a website they can call their own where they can freely share their thoughts without jumping through a million hoops to do it.

The theme is of course heavily inspired by Mr. Sanglard's website design including his design [guidelines](https://fabiensanglard.net/ilike/index.html) but I felt the need to modify them a bit to better explain my ideas for what makes a good website.
